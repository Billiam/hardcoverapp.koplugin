A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

`crash.log` is a file that is automatically created when KOReader crashes. It can normally be found in the KOReader directory:

* `/mnt/private/koreader` for Cervantes
* `koreader/` directory for Kindle
* `.adds/koreader/` directory for Kobo
* `applications/koreader/` directory for Pocketbook

Android logs are kept in memory. Please go to [Menu] → Help → Bug Report to save these logs to a file.

Please try to include the relevant sections in your issue description.
You can upload the whole `crash.log` file (zipped if necessary) on GitHub by dragging and dropping it onto this textbox.
